The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<p>Dancer has evolved quickly from a prototype based on the idea of porting Ruby's
<a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> to a fully featured and popular micro-framework. 
This has been possible thanks to a vast community of users who contributed ideas,
bug reports and patches.</p>
<p>Time after time, some of these users appeared to be very motivated and
productive and it's quite natural that a <i>Core Team</i> emerged.</p>
<p>In this article we'll present each member of the team, so you can put some
faces behind the Git history and IRC users.</p>
<p>The core team is probably the best feature of Dancer, so please, let me
introduce you to the men who make Perl dance!</p>
<h2><a name="alexis_sukrieh__sukria_"></a>Alexis Sukrieh (sukria)</h2>

<img src="/images/2011/23/sukria.jpg">

<p>1442 commits so far, first commit on Jul 17th 2009 (<a href="https://github.com/sukria/Dancer/commit/da6c198">da6c198</a>)</p>
<p>Alexis has been working in the Internet industry for more than ten years. 
He's always been passionate about computer programming and
free software. Perl has always been the language Alexis enjoys the most, and
luckily he always managed to find a paid job with Perl throughout his career.</p>
<p>Before creating Dancer, Alexis used to be a Debian developer and wrote a
popular backup tool called <a href="http://www.backup-manager.org">Backup Manager</a>.</p>
<p>In summer 2009 he started experimenting with a port of the Ruby project 
<a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> in Perl, and that's how Perl Dancer was born. 
Alexis tried hard to build a friendly and responsive community around Dancer, 
he's very happy to see the project evolving by itself.
Alexis now dedicates all his free time on <a href="http://advent.perldancer.org/2011/8">Dancer 2</a>, 
a complete rewrite of the project.</p>
<p>Alexis works at <a href="http://www.weborama.com">Weborama</a>, 
a company that works in the Internet advertisement industry. When not writing
Perl code or terrorizing Weborama's R&amp;D Team, he listens to insane and loud
music.</p>
<p>Alexis runs a <a href="http://www.sukria.net/fr/">blog</a> and has a <a href="http://twitter.com/sukria">Twitter</a>.</p>

checking out several small web frameworks on CPAN. The
responsiveness and kindness in the community prompted him to suggest and develop
his first contribution to Dancer - a route caching system. Since then he has
become a core developer, project mentor and lecturer world-wide.</p>
<p>He is currently the maintainer and release manager of the 1.x branch.</p>

<p>284 commits so far, first one on Feb 11th, 2010 (<a href="https://github.com/sukria/Dancer/commit/b92d612">b92d612</a>)</p>
<p>David Precious (bigpresh) is a professional Perl developer from London,
with 11 years of commercial experience working in the ISP and hosting
market.</p>

improvements and fixes, and eventually ended up with a commit bit.</p>

website and advent calendar, and helps improve the documentation as well as
fixing bugs and adding features.</p>

contributing, and got the commit bit soon after. He has worked at Mandrakesoft, 
Mandriva, IDM, Venda, and now Weborama. He organises the tech meeting of the 
<a href="http://paris.pm.org/">Paris Perl Mongers</a> since September 2011.</p>
